## Features

- Beautiful, readable and very user-friendly design based on Google's material
  design guidelines, packed in a full responsive template with a well-defined
  and easily customizable color palette, great typography, as well as a
  beautiful search interface and footer.

- Well-tested and optimized Javascript and CSS including a cross-browser
  fixed/sticky header, a drawer that even works without Javascript using
  the [checkbox hack](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/08/quick-tip-css-only-dropdowns-with-the-checkbox-hack/) with fallbacks, responsive tables that scroll when
  the screen is too small and well-defined print styles.

- Extra configuration options like a project logo, links to the authors
  GitHub and Twitter accounts and display of the amount of stars the
  project has on GitHub.

- Web application capability on iOS â€“ when the page is saved to the homescreen,
  it behaves and looks like a native application.

See the getting started guide for instructions how to get
it up and running.
